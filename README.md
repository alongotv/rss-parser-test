# rss-parser-test
#### A nice tiny RSS reading app build with Swift for iOS.

This app is currently under development, so do not hesitate to suggest improvements and/or open issues.

In Rss Parser you can browse all your RSS feeds. Just save them in the edit menu, and the Core Data will make sure that they will never be lost. This application uses a [third party library](https://github.com/nmdias/FeedKit) for parsing RSS data.
